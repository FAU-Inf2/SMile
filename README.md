About Us
--------------------------------
SMile (Secure Mail Encryption) is a mobile application developed by students during the course "Mobile Application Development" (MAD) at Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen-NÃ¼rnberg, Germany.

Our vision is to create a mail application that is easy to use and at its core is similar to what people already know from other common mail applications. On top of that we wanted to give you an appealing way to organize your email including a reminder function which will present the email to you again at the given time.

However the main reason for us to develop SMile is that we wanted a way to easily encrypt and decrypt email conversations both with S/MIME and PGP. Our goal is to provide everyone with a secure way to communicate on industrial security standards with a minimum of user interaction.
